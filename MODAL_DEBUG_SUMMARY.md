## ðŸ”§ Added Debugging

Temporary console logs added to track event flow:
1. `Home.book()` â†’ Logs when function is called
2. `Route.handleBook()` â†’ Logs when event received and window event dispatched
3. `Layout.handleOpenBooking()` â†’ Logs when window event received and modal state updated
4. `Layout reactive statement` â†’ Logs current modal state

## ðŸ§ª Test Button

Added temporary red "TEST MODAL" button in hero section that directly triggers booking modal to verify the system works.

## ðŸ“‹ Testing Checklist

To verify everything works:

1. **Click "TEST MODAL" button** â†’ Should open booking modal immediately
2. **Click "Book Now & Save"** â†’ Should open booking modal for Early Bird package
3. **Click "Reserve Your Spot"** â†’ Should open booking modal for Gorilla package  
4. **Click any "Book Now" button** â†’ Should open booking modal for that item
5. **Click Sign In icon** â†’ Should open authentication modal
6. **Check browser console** â†’ Should see debug logs for event flow

## ðŸ§¹ Cleanup Tasks

Once testing is complete:
1. Remove temporary "TEST MODAL" button
2. Remove console.log debugging statements
3. Remove this debug summary file

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Behavior

**Working Event Chain:**
```
Button Click â†’ Home.book() â†’ dispatch('book') â†’ Route.handleBook() â†’ window.dispatchEvent('openBooking') â†’ Layout.handleOpenBooking() â†’ Modal Shows
```

**Working Modal States:**
- `showBookingModal = true` when booking button clicked
- `showAuth = true` when sign in clicked
- Modals only show on non-ProEmpo pages (`!isProEmpoPage`)
