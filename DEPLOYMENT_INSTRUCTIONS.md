Hello,

It seems my messages are not going through correctly. I am creating this file to provide the final instructions for deploying your project to Firebase.

### The Problem

There is a small but important point of confusion with the names you are using:

-   **`shiloh-toModalDebug`** is the name of your entire **repository** (your project).
-   Your main branch, which contains all the latest code and fixes, is named **`main`**.

When Firebase asks for the "Branch to deploy", it is looking for the branch name, which is **`main`**. It appears you were entering the repository name by mistake, which caused the error.

### Final Steps

1.  **You can CLOSE this pull request. You do not need to merge it.** Its only purpose is to deliver this message to you.
2.  Go to your **Firebase App Hosting** page.
3.  Click **"Create rollout"**.
4.  When it asks for the "Branch to deploy", please select or type **`main`**.
5.  Proceed with the deployment.

Because all the fixes are now on your `main` branch, this deployment should succeed.

Thank you for your patience with these technical issues.
